In this paper we have presented a detailed analysis of a large subgraph of the Twitter network.  We first collected a large subgraph of the Twitter system, profiled it, and checked it for error.  Our work is unique in that it provides a method of tracking information flow without being dependant on access to individual messages.  There are a number of pitfalls to message analysis that our work avoids.  A combination of both methods of Twitter network analysis are necessary in order to gain a complete perspective on the way this tool is 
used.

We then identified a number of influence patterns across different attributes within the twitter network.  Finally, we contrasted the bias for different attributes across a set of identified bias patterns.  It is our belief that these measures biases can be viewed as proof of the influence of certain groups within this networked system.
