Our results are visualized for each attribute in figures throughout this paper.  These figures can be interpretted as follows: the groupings that are orderd by row are following the groupings that are ordered by column.  To read the bias for a particular relationship in these charts, find the desired row grouping and move right across the page.  Negative bias relationships are shaded red, and indicate that a row group has a bias against following a particular column group.  Positive bias relationships are shaded green, and indicate that a row group is biased in favor of following a particular column group.  The shade color increases with the strength of the bias.  Relationships that were not contained in our dataset are represented by gray-shaded empty squares.

Figure \ref{fig:follower_count}, a visualization of bias across follower count groupings, reveals a number of interesting facets of our Twitter subgraph.  The most important characteristic is the bias of the diagonal line moving from the top left to botthom right corner of the graph.  This line marks a group's affinity towards following itself, and will be referred to often in this section.  Here, we observe that our groupings are either neutral or subtly positively biased in favor of following their own group.  The strength of this bias increases with the number of followers.  The only exception to this trend is at the lowest follower count level, where our group is biased against following itself.  Throughout our results it can be observed that low degree users behave differently.

Moving away from the downward diagonal in either direction, it can be seen that groups become increasingly biased against following one another.  It looks as though this trend begins to dissipate once the degree of the incoming connection increases to above 50,000.  Unfortunately, this is obscured by the absence of a number of relationships that were not contained in our dataset.  The column for 199,999 represents only a single account in our subgraph, which is why the relationship transitions are so distinct.  This column is not being considered.

Figure \ref{fig:friend_count} contains much of the same trends that are observed in Figure \ref{fig:follower_count}.  A subtle bias towards following users of a similar friend count is clearly visible here along the chart's diagonal.  This bias grows even strong once the groups being followed reach a friend count degree of greater than 2000, at which point there extremely strong bias in favor of following users from these groups.  Unlike with follower count, low degree friend count users at a frequency above that which would be expected in an unbiased network.

Figure \ref{fig:status_count} displays bias patterns for user groupings by status count.  Our intuition here would be that users are likely to connect to user accounts with different degrees of status count.  This intuition is confirmed in the graph.  When considering status count, groupings are biased against following their own group until very high degree groupings are reached.  Low degree tweeters appear to be following high degree tweeters.  High degree tweeters are biased towards following two different degree ranges of users, those of either a very low or very high degree.

Figure \ref{fig:utc_offset} displays attribute relationships for users in different parts of the world by their offset from coordinated universal time.  While, UTC Offset generally refers to a longitudinal slice of the globe, certain offsets are used exclusively by certain countries or regions.  We observe that the strongest positive bias in this chart is at UTC Offset +5.5 following UTC Offset -8.  These two offsets correspond to user accounts in India and Sri Lanka following user accounts in Pacific Standard Time.  All groupings displayed varying degrees of bias against following user accounts at UTC Offset +9, which corresponds to the time zone in Japan and North and South Korea.  It should be noted that some of relationships displayed in this chart were extremely rare in our subgraph and may not be reliable.
 
Figure \ref{fig:listed_count} displays connectivity bias based on the number of Twitter lists tha ta user appears on.  Lists are away to organize and separate different message streams, and our intuition here was that there would be a bias towards following users that appear more frequently on lists.  As it turns out, this trend is only present when considering low degree listed count users.  Groupings of users that appear on over 100 lists display a consistent and considerable bias against following other high degree listed count users.

\subsection{Observations}
Conclude that across these attributes there are several identifiable patterns -- similar users follow eachother, dissimilar users follow eachother, low degree users follow high degree users, extreme low degree users deviate from general usage, extreme high degree users deviate from general usage.  Identify which attributes belong to which patterns.\\

Figures \ref{fig:follower_count}, \ref{fig:friend_count} and \ref{fig:status_count} likely speak to two distinct purposes for which Twitter is used.
